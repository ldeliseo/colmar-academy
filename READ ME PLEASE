I wanted to submit this project before the final deadline even though I did not completely code the last section properly. I am struggling with the CSS Flex Box properties. I still can not get them to behave the way I would like. Any help or feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I would like to continue working on completing this and refining some of the transitions from larger to smaller screens.

Thank you,
Laura D'Eliseo
